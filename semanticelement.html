            Mumbai is bracing for heavy rain today with residents being requested to stay indoors, a day after
            continuous downpour led to waterlogging and the cancellation of at least 11 flights.
            Schools and colleges will remain open in the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) area today, the civic
            body said last night, noting that the rainfall was normal and allowed life in the city to proceed smoothly.
            "Parents are humbly requested not to believe any other information or rumours regarding school and college
            holidays and to rely only on official information from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation. The civic
            administration urges citizens to stay in touch with the management of the concerned schools and colleges for
            more information," the BMC said in an update.
            The police have asked city residents to stay indoors till 8.30 am after the India Meteorological Department
            (IMD) declared a rain "red alert", or forecast heavy rain, in the coastal city.
